# QuizApp



QuizApp is an iOS app that prompts the player with multiple choice questions. For this project, I was given a simple true/false quiz app. The app functioned correctly, though much of the code needed major refactoring. For instance, the app was based on collection types, which needed to be converted into custom classes or structs. Similarly, the app did not adhere to the Model-View-Controller design pattern as well as it could.

The app was improved by fixing all errors and bugs, doing some UI enhancements, creating some custom structs and classes, refactoring according to MVC, accommodating for multiple choices, and creating random non-repeating questions.
